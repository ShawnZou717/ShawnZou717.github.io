I am a PhD student in the Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou, supervised by Prof. Li Qing. Our work focuses on the ocean modelling and its implementation in the Climate models.

Before joining EOAS in 2023, I did my masterâ€™s research in the School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Sci & Tech, working with [Prof. Chen Ping](http://english.eic.hust.edu.cn/info/1019/1220.htm). We are dedicated to the research on satellite measurement of directional wave spectrum. In 2020, a significant breakthrough in the detection theory of spectrometer was achieved by Prof. Chen Ping and I. Our new theory reveals an astonishing fact that the time-varying characteristics of the sea surface have an undeniable impact on observations, even if waves look static to our eyes within the integration time. If you are interested, please refer to [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9300175) for more details.
