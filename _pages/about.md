I am interested in water wave theory, electromagnetic field theory, and their combined application in exploring and understanding our beautiful while dangerous ocean. As physical models are not always analytical and straight forward, sometimes we may need to utilize machine learing (traditional ones or deep learning), high-performance computing and even customized optimization algorithms to speed up and deepen our study.
